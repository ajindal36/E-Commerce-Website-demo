THIS IS A DEMO OF A E-COMMERCE PORTAL FOR BOTH CONSUMER AND INFLUENCER.

Influencer marketing (also influence marketing) is a form of marketing in which focus is on influential people rather than the target market as a whole on social media. It identifies the individuals who have influence over potential customers, and orients marketing activities around these influencers.
Influencer content may be framed as testimonial advertising where they play the role of a potential buyer themselves, or they may be third parties. These third parties exist either in the supply chain (retailers, manufacturers, etc.) or may be so-called value-added influencers (such as journalists, academics, industry analysts, and professional advisers).
Most discussion on the generic topic of social influence centres on compliance and persuasion in a social environment. In the context of influencer marketing, influence is less about argument and coercion to a particular point of view and more about loose interactions between various parties in a community. Influence is often equated to advocacy, but may also be negative, and is thus related to concepts of promoters and detractors
Many influencers social media presence is on both Instagram and Twitter. The rise in popularity of video content means a growing number of influencers can also be found on YouTube.
There are millions of influencers present on the various social media platforms around the globe. These millions have a collective following of over few billions. That is a huge number from the perspective of any marketing analyst. The sheer size of the population that these social media influencers interact with is huge. This makes them the perfect candidates for certain brands who want to advertise their products or services in an attempt to expand their market. Influencer marketing allows such interested parties to accomplish that.
